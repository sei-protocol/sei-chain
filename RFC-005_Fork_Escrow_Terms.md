# RFC-005: Fork Escrow Terms â€” Contested Deployment Guardrails

## Summary
Establishes escrow-based terms for forks or contested deployments derived from SeiKin intellectual property. The RFC ensures that derivative teams escrow royalties and attribution commitments prior to launch.

## Escrow Mechanics
- **Pre-Launch Bond:** Fork operators escrow a royalty bond sized to projected launch TVL.
- **Attribution Proofs:** Forks must publish signed attestations referencing the sovereign seal manifest.
- **Dispute Arbitration:** Breaches are adjudicated through an oracle-driven review process whose findings are executed on-chain.

## Compliance Checklist
1. Register fork details with the SeiKin sovereign registry.
2. Provide escrow transaction hash and authorized withdrawal conditions.
3. Include cross-chain settlement adapters honoring the SeiKin royalty hooks.
