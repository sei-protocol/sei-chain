# the zero-copied slices must not be retained beyond current block's execution.
# the sdk address cache will be disabled if zero-copy is enabled.

# SnapshotInterval defines the block interval at which SeiDB takes state-commit snapshots.
# When a node restarts, it needs to "replay changelog entries" from the last snapshot to the current height.
# - Smaller interval (e.g., 1000): Faster node restarts, but more snapshots consume more disk space
# - Larger interval (e.g., 100000): Slower node restarts, but uses less disk space
# Default: 10000 blocks (recommended for most nodes)
# Note: This is the setting teams often ask about when they want to reduce restart time.

# Supported backends: pebbledb, rocksdb
# defaults to pebbledb (recommended)

# AsyncWriteBuffer defines the async queue length for commits to be applied to State Store
# Set <= 0 for synchronous writes, which means commits also need to wait for data to be persisted in State Store.

# Setting it to 0 means keep everything
