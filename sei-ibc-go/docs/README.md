# IBC

Welcome to the IBC-Go documentation!

The inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC) is an end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol for reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains arranged in an unknown and dynamic topology. 
The protocol realises this by specifying a set of data structures, abstractions, and semantics that can be implemented by any distributed ledger provided they satisfy a small set of requirements.

IBC can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications, which include token transfers, atomic swaps, multi-chain smart contracts (with or without mutually comprehensible VMs), and data & code sharding of various kinds.
