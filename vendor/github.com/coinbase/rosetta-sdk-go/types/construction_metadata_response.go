// ConstructionMetadataResponse The ConstructionMetadataResponse returns network-specific metadata
// used for transaction construction. Optionally, the implementer can return the suggested fee
// associated with the transaction being constructed. The caller may use this info to adjust the
// intent of the transaction or to create a transaction with a different account that can pay the
// suggested fee. Suggested fee is an array in case fee payment must occur in multiple currencies.
