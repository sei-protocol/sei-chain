// AccountCoinsResponse AccountCoinsResponse is returned on the /account/coins endpoint and includes

type AccountCoinsResponse struct {
	BlockIdentifier *BlockIdentifier `json:"block_identifier"`
	// If a blockchain is UTXO-based, all unspent Coins owned by an account_identifier should be
	// returned alongside the balance. It is highly recommended to populate this field so that users
	// of the Rosetta API implementation don't need to maintain their own indexer to track their
	// UTXOs.
	Coins []*Coin `json:"coins"`
	// Account-based blockchains that utilize a nonce or sequence number should include that number
	// in the metadata. This number could be unique to the identifier or global across the account
	// address.
