// AccountBalanceResponse An AccountBalanceResponse is returned on the /account/balance endpoint. If
// an account has a balance for each AccountIdentifier describing it (ex: an ERC-20 token balance on
// a few smart contracts), an account balance request must be made with each AccountIdentifier. The
// `coins` field was removed and replaced by by `/account/coins` in `v1.4.7`.
