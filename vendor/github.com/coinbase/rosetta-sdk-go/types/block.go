// Block Blocks contain an array of Transactions that occurred at a particular BlockIdentifier. A
// hard requirement for blocks returned by Rosetta implementations is that they MUST be
// _inalterable_: once a client has requested and received a block identified by a specific
// BlockIndentifier, all future calls for that same BlockIdentifier must return the same block
// contents.
