// OperationIdentifier The operation_identifier uniquely identifies an operation within a

type OperationIdentifier struct {
	// The operation index is used to ensure each operation has a unique identifier within a
	// transaction. This index is only relative to the transaction and NOT GLOBAL. The operations in
	// each transaction should start from index 0. To clarify, there may not be any notion of an
	// operation index in the blockchain being described.
	Index int64 `json:"index"`
	// Some blockchains specify an operation index that is essential for client use. For example,
	// Bitcoin uses a network_index to identify which UTXO was used in a transaction. network_index
	// should not be populated if there is no notion of an operation index in a blockchain
	// (typically most account-based blockchains).
