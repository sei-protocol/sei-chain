// ExemptionType ExemptionType is used to indicate if the live balance for an account subject to a
// BalanceExemption could increase above, decrease below, or equal the computed balance. *
// greater_or_equal: The live balance may increase above or equal the computed balance. This
// typically   occurs with staking rewards that accrue on each block. * less_or_equal: The live
// balance may decrease below or equal the computed balance. This typically   occurs as balance
// moves from locked to spendable on a vesting account. * dynamic: The live balance may increase
// above, decrease below, or equal the computed balance. This   typically occurs with tokens that
// have a dynamic supply.
