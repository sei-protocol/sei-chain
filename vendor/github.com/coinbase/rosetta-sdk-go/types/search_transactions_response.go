type SearchTransactionsResponse struct {
	// transactions is an array of BlockTransactions sorted by most recent BlockIdentifier (meaning
	// that transactions in recent blocks appear first). If there are many transactions for a
	// particular search, transactions may not contain all matching transactions. It is up to the

	// total_count is the number of results for a given search. Callers typically use this value to
	// concurrently fetch results by offset or to display a virtual page number associated with
	// results.
	TotalCount int64 `json:"total_count"`
	// next_offset is the next offset to use when paginating through transaction results. If this
	// field is not populated, there are no more transactions to query.
