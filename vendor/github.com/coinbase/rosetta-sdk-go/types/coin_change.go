// coin_identifier. This object is part of the Operation model and must be populated for UTXO-based
// blockchains. Coincidentally, this abstraction of UTXOs allows for supporting both account-based
// transfers and UTXO-based transfers on the same blockchain (when a transfer is account-based,
// don't populate this model).
