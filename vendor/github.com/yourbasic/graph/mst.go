package graph

// MST computes a minimum spanning tree for each connected component
// of an undirected weighted graph.
// The forest of spanning trees is returned as a slice of parent pointers:
// parent[v] is either the parent of v in a tree,
// or -1 if v is the root of a tree.
//
// The time complexity is O(|E|â‹…log|V|), where |E| is the number of edges
// and |V| the number of vertices in the graph.
