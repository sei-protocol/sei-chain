# wasmvm

This is a wrapper around the
[CosmWasm VM](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/tree/main/packages/vm). It
allows you to compile, initialize and execute CosmWasm smart contracts from Go
applications, in particular from
[x/wasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/tree/master/x/wasm).

## Structure

This repo contains both Rust and Go code. The Rust code is compiled into a
library (shared `.dll`/`.dylib`/`.so` or static `.a`) to be linked via cgo and
wrapped with a pleasant Go API. The full build step involves compiling Rust -> C
library, and linking that library to the Go code. For ergonomics of the user, we
will include pre-compiled libraries to easily link with, and Go developers
should just be able to import this directly.

### Rust code

The Rust code lives in a sub-folder `./libwasmvm`. This folder compiles to a
library that can be used via FFI. It is compiled like this:

```sh
# Run unit tests
(cd libwasmvm && cargo test)

# Create release build for your current system. Uses whatever default Rust
# version you have installed.
make build-rust

# Create reproducible release builds for other systems (slow, don't use for development)
make release-build-alpine
make release-build-linux
make release-build-macos
make release-build-windows
```

### Go code

The Go code consistes of three packages:

1. The types (the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/types` import), using
   `package types`
2. The internal package `internal/api`, using `package api`
3. This repo (the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` import), using `package cosmwasm`

The dependencies between them are as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    api-->types;
    cosmwasm-->types;
    cosmwasm-->api;
```

The Go code is built like this:

```
make build-go
make test
```

#### Package github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/types

This packages contains types used by the two other packages. It can be compiled
without cgo.

```sh
# Build
go build ./types
# Build without CGO
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./types
```

#### Package internal/api

This package contains the code binding the libwasmvm build to the Go code. All
low level FFI handling code belongs there. This package can only be built using
cgo. Uing the `internal/` convention makes this package fully private.

#### Package github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm

This is the package users import. It can be compiled without cgo, but when you
do so, a lot of functionality is removed.

```sh
# Build
go build .
# Build without CGO
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build .
```

## Supported Platforms

See [COMPILER_VERSIONS.md](docs/COMPILER_VERSIONS.md) for information on Go and
Rust compiler support.

The Rust implementation of the VM is compiled to a library called libwasmvm.
This is then linked to the Go code when the final binary is built. For that
reason not all systems supported by Go are supported by this project.

Linux (tested on Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS7, Alpine) and macOS is supported. We
are working on Windows (#288).

### Builds of libwasmvm

Our system currently supports the following builds. In general we can only
support targets that are
[supported by Wasmer's singlepass backend](https://docs.wasmer.io/ecosystem/wasmer/wasmer-features#compiler-support-by-chipset),
which for example excludes all 32 bit systems.

## Docs

Run `(cd libwasmvm && cargo doc --no-deps --open)`.

## Design

Please read the [Documentation](./spec/Index.md) to understand both the general
[Architecture](./spec/Architecture.md), as well as the more detailed
[Specification](./spec/Specification.md) of the parameters and entry points.

## Development

There are two halfs to this code - go and rust. The first step is to ensure that
there is a proper dll built for your platform. This should be `api/libwasmvm.X`,
where X is:

- `so` for Linux systems
- `dylib` for MacOS
- `dll` for Windows - Not currently supported due to upstream dependency

If this is present, then `make test` will run the Go test suite and you can
import this code freely. If it is not present you will have to build it for your
system, and ideally add it to this repo with a PR (on your fork). We will set up
a proper CI system for building these binaries, but we are not there yet.

To build the rust side, try `make build-rust` and wait for it to compile. This
depends on `cargo` being installed with `rustc` version 1.47+. Generally, you
can just use `rustup` to install all this with no problems.
