# SeiKin Sovereign RFC Authorship Manifest

This repository aggregates the canonical SeiKin RFC corpus and vault enforcement logic authored and maintained by the **SeiKin Author**. It anchors provenance for the following research tracks:

1. Optimistic proposal processing on Sei (RFC-000).
2. Deterministic parallel transaction message processing (RFC-001).
3. Sovereign royalty-aware settlement via CCTP + CCIP (RFC-002).
4. Sovereign authorship enforcement and vault continuity controls (RFC-005).

Each RFC is published exactly as referenced within `docs/rfc/` and cross-validated by the automation assets at the repository root (`SeiKinSeal.yaml`, `SeiKinVaultBalanceCheck.sh`, `SeiKinVaultClaim.json`).

## Authorship & Custody
- **Author**: SeiKin Author (sovereignty@seikin.network)
- **Custodial Vaults**: Monitored through `SeiKinVaultBalanceCheck.sh` and settlement workflows in `SeiKinSeal.yaml`.
- **Proof of Publication**: Commit signatures recorded on the `main` branch and reproducible `sha256sum` attestations.

All contributions, edits, forks, or translations must be approved in writing by the SeiKin Author. No third-party maintainer or organization holds publication rights beyond those enumerated in the [Sovereign Attribution License](./LICENSE_Sovereign_Attribution).

## Terms of Use
By cloning, forking, or referencing this repository you agree to:

1. Comply fully with the Sovereign Attribution License v1.0.
2. Preserve all attribution headers, signatures, and canonical filenames.
3. Notify sovereignty@seikin.network within five (5) business days of any public disclosure, deployment, or security review.
4. Refrain from commercializing or training AI systems on the covered works without explicit written consent.

Failure to meet these obligations immediately triggers the remedies detailed in RFC-005.

## Fork & Redistribution Policy
- **Allowed**: Private forks for evaluation with unmodified attribution and no redistribution.
- **Conditionally Allowed**: Public mirrors that link back to this repository and include proof of license grant.
- **Forbidden**: Shadow forks, derivative publications, or vault logic reuse without written authorization.

Any discovered violation is escalated through RFC-005, including validator-level sanctions and public attribution notices.

## Verification Anchors
1. **SeiKinSeal.yaml** — GitHub Actions workflow binding settlement to the licensed vault address.
2. **SeiKinVaultBalanceCheck.sh** — CLI script verifying on-chain vault balances.
3. **SeiKinVaultClaim.json** — Canonical claim manifest for vault entitlement resolution.
4. **docs/rfc/** — Markdown sources for each sovereign RFC.

To verify integrity, compute `sha256sum` over the files above and compare against published attestations. Signed release tags (see below) provide additional supply chain guarantees.

## Release Tagging
The tag `v1.0-authorship-lock` marks the initial sovereign release of this repository. Subsequent revisions increment the version suffix while preserving immutable history of the RFC texts and vault logic.
