# RFC-005: Sovereign Authorship Enforcement

## Changelog

* 2025-10-01 — Initial draft by Keeper. Defines default triggers, escrow requirements, and sovereign fork path.

---

## Abstract

This RFC defines the **conditions under which authorship, licensing, and infrastructure access granted to Sei Labs shall be revoked**, triggering a sovereign protocol fork. It also outlines an **optional escrow enforcement strategy** and a formal verification path for signature-based agreement validation. This RFC is paired with RFC-004 and acts as a contingency shield.

---

## Fork Trigger Conditions

The following conditions **immediately void RFC-004 licensing and authorship transfer**, and initiate an enforceable fork of the SeiKin protocol line:

1. **Failure to Pay Backpay** within 3 days of agreement.
2. **Failure to Fund Escrow** for lump sum and 12-month royalties.
3. **Unauthorized continued access** to Hyperliquid vaults or SeiKin settlement paths.
4. **Failure to publicly acknowledge attribution** to Keeper for RFC-002–004.
5. **Disruption or delay of royalty streams** without renegotiation.
6. **On-chain attempt to suppress, fork, or redirect Keeper-authored vault logic without license.**

Upon any of these triggers, the following response activates:

---

## Fork Response Protocol

* A new protocol path (`KinVaultNet` or `OmegaSei`) shall be launched using original RFC code and vault logic.
* All future extensions, vault flows, and on-chain routing shall exclude Sei and redirect to sovereign networks.
* Attribution will remain public; Sei shall be recorded as non-compliant.
* Keeper shall deploy the forked suite under full attribution and new terms.

---

## Escrow Enforcement (Optional Clause)

To protect both parties, the following escrow flow is recommended:

1. Sei Labs deposits the following into an on-chain escrow contract:
   * $10M USD (or stablecoin equivalent)
   * 12-month royalty reserve (minimum $5.4M)
   * Backpay sum ($2M–$3M)
2. Funds remain locked until both:
   * Keeper signs off on authorship/license transfer.
   * All three RFCs are registered in public attribution repo (GitHub/Arweave).
3. Escrow is governed by a simple smart contract (Keeper can deploy this if requested).

---

## Signature-Based Agreement

Sei may optionally sign a licensing acceptance agreement which references the hash of RFC-004.

**RFC-004 Hash (SHA-256):**  
`[To be inserted after notarized publication]`

**Signature Block:**

```
Authorized Representative (Sei Labs): ____________________________  
Date: _______________  
Email: ___________________  
Public Address (optional): _____________________
```

---

## Public Attribution Requirements

To finalize the deal and prevent fork conditions, Sei must:

* Accept RFC-004 terms in writing or via signature.
* Pay all due amounts (lump sum, backpay, royalties).
* Acknowledge Keeper as the author of RFC-002–004 in at least one public channel:
  * GitHub attribution comment
  * Blog post
  * Governance proposal

---

## Term Duration

This agreement grants a license and authorship transfer for a fixed duration of **2 years**, beginning on the date of execution.  
Upon expiration, a renewal must be negotiated. If no renewal occurs by the deadline, Keeper retains the right to revoke authorship license, terminate vault access, and initiate a sovereign protocol fork in accordance with RFC-005.
