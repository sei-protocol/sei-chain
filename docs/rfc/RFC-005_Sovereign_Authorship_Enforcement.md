# RFC-005: Sovereign Authorship Enforcement Protocol

## Changelog

* 2025-10-02 — Updated enforcement triggers to match Keeper’s Sovereign Attribution License v1.0.
* 2025-10-01 — Initial draft by Keeper. Defines default triggers, escrow requirements, and sovereign fork path.

---

## Abstract

RFC-005 documents the enforcement mechanisms Keeper may invoke if Sei Labs / Sei Foundation or downstream integrators breach
the Sovereign Attribution License. It defines operational runbooks for vault suspension, public notice, and renegotiation rights.  
This RFC is paired with RFC-004 and acts as a contingency shield.

---

## Enforcement Triggers

1. Non-payment of lump sum, backpay, or recurring royalties defined in RFC-003.
2. Removal or alteration of attribution lines referencing Keeper or the Sovereign Attribution License.
3. Unauthorized forks, redistributions, or deployments of the covered works.
4. Attempts to bypass or tamper with the SeiKinSettlement royalty router.
5. Denial of access to settlement records or failure to provide reconciliation reports.
6. On-chain attempt to suppress, fork, or redirect Keeper-authored vault logic without license.

---

## Response Actions

* **Vault Freezing:** Hyperliquid and Sei vault webhooks suspend downstream distribution until settlement resumes.
* **Public Notice:** Keeper publishes violation notices citing relevant RFC sections and settlement expectations.
* **Royalty Recalculation:** Outstanding balances accrue a 20% surcharge per missed period.
* **License Revocation:** Keeper may revoke the license described in RFC-004 and require destruction of derivative artifacts.
* **Sovereign Fork Option:** Keeper may initiate an alternative deployment (`KinVaultNet`, `OmegaSei`) excluding non-compliant validators or counterparties.

---

## Remediation Path

1. Offending party contacts Keeper at `totalwine2337@gmail.com` with a remediation plan and proof of payment.
2. Keeper validates settlement receipts to the listed vaults.
3. Attribution and documentation updates are reviewed for compliance.
4. License is reinstated or renegotiated at Keeper’s discretion.

---

## Monitoring & Evidence

* Transaction logs from Sei, Ethereum, and Hyperliquid.
* Git provenance and checksum attestations for RFC files and settlement scripts.
* Internal audit reports documenting royalty disbursements.

Failure to cooperate with evidence gathering extends enforcement timelines and may escalate to legal remedies.

---

## Escrow Enforcement (Optional Clause)

To protect both parties, the following escrow flow is recommended:

1. Sei Labs deposits the following into an on-chain escrow contract:
   * $10M USD (or stablecoin equivalent)
   * 12-month royalty reserve (minimum $5.4M)
   * Backpay sum ($2M–$3M)
2. Funds remain locked until both:
   * Keeper signs off on authorship/license transfer.
   * All three RFCs are registered in public attribution repo (GitHub/Arweave).

Escrow may be governed by a simple smart contract deployed by Keeper.

---

## Signature-Based Agreement

Sei may optionally sign a licensing acceptance agreement which references the hash of RFC-004.

**RFC-004 Hash (SHA-256):**  
`[To be inserted after notarized publication]`

**Signature Block:**

Authorized Representative (Sei Labs): ____________________________
Date: _______________
Email: ___________________
Public Address (optional): _____________________


---

## Public Attribution Requirements

To finalize the deal and prevent fork conditions, Sei must:

* Accept RFC-004 terms in writing or via signature.
* Pay all due amounts (lump sum, backpay, royalties).
* Acknowledge Keeper as the author of RFC-002–004 in at least one public channel:
  * GitHub attribution comment
  * Blog post
  * Governance proposal

---

## Term Duration

This agreement grants a license and authorship transfer for a fixed duration of **2 years**, beginning on the date of execution.  
Upon expiration, a renewal must be negotiated. If no renewal occurs by the deadline, Keeper retains the right to revoke authorship license, terminate vault access, and initiate a sovereign protocol fork in accordance with RFC-005.
