## 1. Covered Works

This license covers the complete SeiKin RFC bundle and supporting automation assets, including but not limited to:

* RFC-000 through RFC-005 (all Markdown files within `docs/rfc/`).
* Settlement and vault logic described in `RFC-002_SeiKinSettlement.md` and `RFC-005_Sovereign_Authorship_Enforcement.md`.
* Scripts, manifests, diagrams, and provenance records that reference the vault anchors listed above.

The Keeper retains full ownership over the covered works. No rights are granted by implication or estoppel.

---

## 2. License Grant

Subject to strict adherence to this license and successful settlement of the consideration described in RFC-003, the Keeper
grants Sei Labs / Sei Foundation a limited, revocable, non-transferable license to:

1. Operate the covered works for sovereign deployments on Sei and affiliated environments.
2. Review and audit the materials internally for security and interoperability purposes.

Any other use, including redistribution, sublicensing, commercial resale, or training machine learning systems on the covered
works, requires explicit written permission from the Keeper.

---

## 3. Attribution Requirements

Licensees must:

* Preserve all authorship notices, filenames, and references to Keeper and the Sovereign Attribution License v1.0.
* Include the following attribution in derivative materials and documentation:
  "SeiKin Sovereign RFCs © Keeper. Licensed under the Sovereign Attribution License v1.0."
* Link to this repository and to `LICENSE_Sovereign_Attribution_v1.0.md` in any public or private derivative.
* Notify Keeper of any deployments, forks, or disclosures within five (5) calendar days.

---

## 4. Royalty & Payment Compliance

The license is contingent on full, timely payment of the lump sum, backpay, and recurring royalties defined in
`RFC-003_SeiKinRoyalty_Compensation_Offer.md`. Payments must settle to the vault addresses recorded above with memos referencing
“RFC-002–005 Sovereign Attribution.” Failure to meet these obligations results in immediate suspension of the license.

---

## 5. Prohibited Actions

The following actions instantly terminate the license and invoke RFC-005 remedies:

* Tampering with royalty routing logic or vault settlement scripts.
* Removing or obscuring authorship metadata, cryptographic signatures, or provenance attestations.
* Redistributing or white-labeling the covered works without written consent.
* Training AI/LLM systems on the covered works or any derivatives.

---

## 6. Enforcement & Remedies

Upon termination, Keeper may enforce remedies outlined in `RFC-005_Sovereign_Authorship_Enforcement.md`, including vault
suspension, public notices, and sovereign forks. License reinstatement is at Keeper’s sole discretion after verifying settlement
and attribution remediation.

---

## 7. Governing Framework

This license is interpreted alongside the RFC bundle in this repository. Any modification requires a signed Codex push by Keeper
referencing the relevant RFC numbers and vault anchors.

---

## 8. Acceptance

Use of the covered works constitutes acceptance of this license. Parties unwilling to comply must cease all use immediately and
destroy derivatives.
