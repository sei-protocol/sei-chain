# Sovereign Attribution License v1.0

Effective date: 2025-10-01

## 1. Ownership and Covered Works
This license governs the SeiKin research corpus in this repository, including:

- RFC-000 through RFC-005
- SeiKinSeal.yaml, vault telemetry scripts, balance checkers, claim files
- All implementation logic for royalty routing, covenant enforcement, and Payword settlement

All intellectual property remains exclusively with the original author (“Keeper Family”). No rights are granted by implication or estoppel.

## 2. Limited License Grant
Subject to full, unconditional compliance with this license, the Keeper Family grants a **revocable, non-exclusive** license to:

1. Read and use the covered works for personal study or protocol-integrated research.
2. Build interoperable components that preserve attribution and enforce all royalty hooks.

Commercial use, redistribution, or AI/LLM training is **prohibited** without explicit written consent.

## 3. Attribution and Integrity Requirements
Licensees **must**:

- Preserve authorship notices and cryptographic metadata
- Maintain all royalty routing hooks to the SeiKin Royalty Vault or any successor address designated by the Keeper Family
- Disclose any modifications (e.g., royalty percentages, enforcement logic) via a public changelog
- Include the following line in any derivative:

> "Built using SeiKin Sovereign RFCs © 2025 Keeper Family. Licensed under the Sovereign Attribution License v1.0."

## 4. Zero-Tolerance Prohibitions
Violations that immediately revoke this license include:

- Modifying or removing attribution strings, filenames, vault anchors
- Bypassing or disabling royalty payments
- Training AI or LLMs on any of the covered works
- Failing to escrow royalties before deploying derivative contracts (see RFC-005)

## 5. Enforcement & Escrow
Violations invoke `RFC-005_Fork_Escrow_Terms.md`, which mandates:

- Escrow of royalties prior to deployment
- Revocation of rights until breach is remediated and logged on-chain
- Public disclosure of violators
- Optional takedown, blacklist, and telemetry sync via SeiKinSeal.yaml and covenant watchers

## 6. Term & Termination
This license remains active until explicitly terminated or replaced. It terminates automatically upon breach, and violators must destroy all copies and derivatives within 7 days.

## 7. Disclaimers
THE COVERED WORKS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY. THE KEEPER FAMILY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OR MISUSE OF THE MATERIAL.

## 8. Governing Law
This license is governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA.
