# Sovereign Attribution License v1.0

Effective date: 2024-02-20

## 1. Ownership and Covered Works
This license governs the SeiKin research corpus contained in this repository, including without limitation the following Request for Comments (RFC) specifications and all associated diagrams, scripts, vault logic, and settlement automation assets:

- RFC-000: Optimistic Proposal Processing
- RFC-001: Parallel Transaction Message Processing
- RFC-002: SeiKinSettlement — Sovereign Royalty Enforcement via CCTP + CCIP
- RFC-005: Sovereign Authorship Enforcement & Vault Continuity Controls
- SeiKinSeal.yaml, SeiKinVaultBalanceCheck.sh, SeiKinVaultClaim.json, and any successor artifacts that implement, simulate, or monitor SeiKin vault logic.

All intellectual property rights in the covered works remain exclusively with the original author ("SeiKin Author"). No rights are granted by implication or estoppel.

## 2. Limited License Grant
Subject to full, unconditional compliance with this agreement, the SeiKin Author grants a revocable, non-exclusive license to:

1. Read the covered works for personal study or protocol-internal review.
2. Reference the covered works for interoperability implementations, provided that every public or private derivative includes an explicit attribution notice linking back to this repository and to RFC-005.

No other rights are granted. Commercial use, republication, redistribution, derivative publication, or training of machine learning systems on the covered works requires prior written consent from the SeiKin Author.

## 3. Attribution and Integrity Requirements
Licensees **must**:

- Preserve all authorship notices, cryptographic signatures, provenance metadata, and canonical filenames.
- Include the following attribution in any derivative or implementation notes:
  "SeiKin Sovereign RFCs © SeiKin Author. Licensed under the Sovereign Attribution License v1.0."
- Notify the SeiKin Author of any forks, deployments, or audits within five (5) business days of public disclosure.

## 4. Zero-Tolerance Prohibitions
The following actions immediately terminate the license and trigger enforcement under RFC-005:

- Removing, obscuring, or modifying authorship marks or vault verification anchors.
- Attempting to bypass SeiKin royalty flows, vault settlement checks, or attribution enforcement logic.
- Commercializing any portion of the covered works without explicit written approval.
- Training AI or LLM systems on the covered works or any derivatives thereof.

## 5. Enforcement & Remedies (RFC-005 Invocation)
Any violation automatically invokes RFC-005: Sovereign Authorship Enforcement & Vault Continuity Controls. Remedies include, without limitation:

- Public attribution notice identifying the violating party and the scope of infringement.
- Revocation of all usage rights and issuance of DMCA or equivalent takedown requests.
- Mandatory disgorgement of profits realized through unauthorized use.
- Network-level sanctions, including blocklist propagation to SeiKin-aligned validators and royalty oracles.

Compliance reviews may leverage SeiKinSeal.yaml, vault telemetry scripts, and third-party attestations to establish provenance.

## 6. Term & Termination
This license remains in effect until terminated. Termination occurs automatically upon breach, upon written notice from the SeiKin Author, or upon replacement by a subsequent signed license version. Post-termination, the licensee must permanently delete all copies of the covered works and certify destruction within seven (7) days.

THE SEIKIN AUTHOR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING FROM USE OF THE COVERED WORKS.
