Update contracts via e.g.

```sh
cd testdata
./download_releases.sh v0.14.0-beta2
```

This will download the deployed builds [from GitHub releases](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/releases).

If contracts are not available for some reason or you need to compile for
an unreleased commit, you can build them manually using
[these instructions](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/v0.14.0-beta2/contracts/README.md#optimized-builds).
